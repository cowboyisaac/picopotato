# Intro

I am but a pico potato (that's one trillionth of a potato!) hoping to share simple, genuine, and good stuffs in the vast digital garden. 

- Simple: easy to understand, like a potato, no fancy garnish needed. 
- Genuine: Straight from the ground, genuine and honest.
- Good: practical and useful like a nutritious potato.
